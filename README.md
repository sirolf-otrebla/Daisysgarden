the project is based on CSS3, HTML5 and Javascript.

## Template used:
the footer's code is taken from another web application, but we can not remember where we take it.


## External scripts, API and plugins:
we used:

1. bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/)

2. jQuery (https://jquery.com/)

3. popper (https://popper.js.org/)

4. Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)

## Main difficulties faced during the project development:

the most difficult issue to overcame was making the website responsive without breaking containers, titles images and similar elements.
we all started from zero experience on web design and we are satisfied by our work.
